Pokemon Database Search 

Our target browsers would be modern versions of both Chrome and Firefox on primarily Desktop/Laptop browsers. 

We used the PokeAPI for this project (https://pokeapi.co/) to get data for all available Pokemon. 
Our project uses the images for each Pokemon to create a small information card for each Pokemon in the database.
We used the Animate on Scroll (AOS) javascript library for this webpage. 
We used the keyframes CSS framework in our project.
Our actual project is allowing users to look up pokemon, using a variety of attributes, such as name, type, height, weight, moves, and abilites.  This allows users to search for Pokemon using a variety of different attributes.
