Pokemon Database Search 

Our target browsers would be modern versions of both Chrome and Firefox on primarily Desktop/Laptop browsers. 

We used the PokeAPI for this project (https://pokeapi.co/) to get data for all available Pokemon. 
Our project uses the images for each Pokemon to create a small information card for each Pokemon in the database.
We used the Animate on Scroll (AOS) javascript library for this webpage. 
We did not use a CSS framework.
Our actual project is allowing users to look up pokemon, using their full name or just a portion of their name.  This also allows users to search us sections of pokemon names that are shared with future evolutions (char, nido, saur) to see all evolutions of that specific Pokemon tree.
